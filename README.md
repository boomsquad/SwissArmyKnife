This program takes a JSON file and reads the contents of the specified file. There are three main functions -Help, -HttpRequest, and -HttpRequestIndex. -Help gives you information on what to do. -HttpRequest grabs a specified URL and reads it back to the user.             -HttpRequestIndex gives the user the all the URLs and then breaks them down to the information inside.
